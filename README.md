- This is a repository to showcase my work in attempts of refining my Graphic Design capabilities. I'd set out to create a Simplistic, Subtle, yet Standout design of my own, and the contents of this archive hopefully reflect so!
<br>

- Going through with this project was fun, I got to get on the ropes of many different aspects of Design, such as, _Size_, _Alignment_, _Spacing_, _Typography_ and then especially, _Colors_.
  - I'd considered modern minimalist designs to be the base of the project, with their merit being ease-of-use and praticality.
  - Still, I advocate for "fun" to be blended in with minimalist designs, I think it adds more to it in terms of personality, flair and messaging. This project has helped me learn a bit more on how to blend these 2 ideas without either of them taking out from the other.
  - My skills in Figma were also thoroughly tested and were tempered through understanding the nuances of the app more closely.
<br>

- For the background graphics, the "patterns" are something I incorporated to add said "flair". They are heavily inspired by the Spellcard patterns from the legendary ___Touhou Project___ by ZUN.
  - Making them was a project of its own, I'd had to get into the Maths behind such intricate patterns emerging so flawlessly. Tinkering around in _Geogebra_ was a lot of work, but equally as fun!

<br>

- I wish to extensively talk about the development phase and the thoughts behind all the design choices I made in this project.

- This project isn't perfect, as I'd been able to get it critiqued through various sources and later critiqued it myself too. The learning experience is what is of the most value and I strive to make developments in Graphic Design & Web Development moving forward!
